# Installation Guide

Welcome to the installation guide for Sting React. Follow these steps to get the component library up and running in your project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- **Node.js**: v18 or higher.
- **React**: v18.
- **NPM Token**: You must have an `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable set up in your shell.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure NPM Token

You need to have an `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable defined in your shell. You can set it by running the following command in your terminal:


To make this variable permanent, add the export command to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).

### 2. Create .npmrc File

In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.npmrc` and add the following line to it. This file will authenticate you with the NPM registry using your token.

```
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

### 3. Install the Library

Once your environment is set up, you can install the Sting React library from the NPM registry:

```bash
npm install @chargebee/sting-react
```

### 4. Import Styles

To ensure that all components are styled correctly, import the CSS file in your project's root file (e.g., `main.tsx`, `index.js`):

```jsx
import '@chargebee/sting-react/sting-react.css';
```

### 5. Usage Example

You can now import and use the components in your application. Here's a basic example of how to use the SButton component:

```jsx
import { SButton } from '@chargebee/sting-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SButton variant="primary">Click Me</SButton>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
